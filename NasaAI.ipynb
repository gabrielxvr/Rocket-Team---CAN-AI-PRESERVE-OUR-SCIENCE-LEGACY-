For a scale-invariant spectrum of gravitational waves, the effects are most significant at the smallest multipoles (2≤ℓ≤5), but typically suppressed by six or more orders of magnitude with respect to scalar contributions for currently allowed amplitudes of the inflationary gravitational wave background. We also discuss the most relevant second-order terms, corresponding to the distortion of tracer correlation functions by gravitational waves.

These suggestions are based on calculations of “local precision” for particular nonlinear schemes. However, we show that there is no simple connection between the local precision and the average estimation error for these schemes, leading to a scaling puzzle. This puzzle is partially resolved by a careful analysis of iterative implementations of the suggested nonlinear schemes. However, it is shown that the suggested nonlinear schemes are still limited to an exponential scaling in n. (This scaling may be compared to the exponential scaling in n which is achievable if multiple passes are allowed, even for linear schemes.) The question of whether nonlinear schemes may have a scaling advantage in the presence of loss is left open. Our results are based on a new bound for average estimation error that depends on (i)\\xa0an entropic measure of the degree to which the probe state can encode a reference phase value, called the G asymmetry, and (ii)\\xa0any prior information about the phase shift. This bound is asymptotically stronger than bounds based on the variance of the phase-shift generator. The G asymmetry is also shown to directly bound the average information gained per estimate.

We explore a scenario, first proposed in [A.\\u2009E. Nelson, Phys. Rev.

We find these PDFs to be highly non-Gaussian in both cases. We also evaluate the variance with which the trispectrum amplitude can be measured, ⟨Δτ^nl2⟩, as a function of its underlying value, τnl. We find a strong dependence of this variance on τnl. We also find that the variance does not, given the highly non-Gaussian nature of the PDF, effectively characterize the distribution.

Here we study the effect of curvature on constraints on parameters used to test general relativity (GR) at cosmological scales, commonly known as modified growth (MG) parameters. While current data taken in the context of the ΛCDM model points to a universe that is spatially flat, this constraint does not necessarily hold in modified gravity theories or even in relativistic inhomogeneous cosmological models. Using the latest cosmological data sets we find that MG parameters are correlated with the curvature parameter Ωk and the constraints on the MG parameters are weakened compared to when Ωk is not included in the parameter analysis. We next use various future simulated data sets, including cosmic microwave background, weak lensing, and Integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations, where the fiducial model is spatially curved but we assume a flat model when fitting the MG parameters. We find the assumption of a spatially flat model on a spatially curved universe does indeed cause an artificial shift in the constraints on the MG parameters, in some cases even producing an apparent deviation from GR in the MG parameter space. For our simulated data, tension with GR begins to manifest itself for fiducial models with |Ωk|≥0.02 and apparent deviations appear for |Ωk|≥0.05. We find that for negatively curved models the apparent deviation is more significant. The manifestation of this apparent deviation from GR due to the assumption of spatial flatness above leads one to conclude that, when using future high-precision data to perform these tests, spatial curvature must be included in the parameter analysis along with the other core cosmological parameters and the MG parameters.'},\n",

The predicted velocity dependent fragmentation patterns and composition mixing ratios agree with INMS data providing the means for identifying the molecules in the plume. We used our simulations to predict the surface damage from the HV impacts on the INMS interior walls, which we suggest acts as a titanium sublimation pump that could alter the instrument’s readings. These results show how the theory can identify chemical events from hypervelocity impacts in space plumes and atmospheres, providing in turn clues to the internal structure of the corresponding sources (e.g., Enceladus).

Exceptions to this trend occur at select high values of v where the scattering lengths are modulated by orders of magnitude corresponding to the location of an s-wave zero-energy resonance in “vibration space.” The quasiresonant mechanisms, which are not very sensitive to the details of the interaction potential, generally control the final distribution of molecular states for any given initial distribution.

However, for some calculations, particularly those involving observations performed on a spherical sky, a decomposition into waves of fixed total angular momentum (TAM) may be more appropriate. Here we introduce TAM waves—solutions of fixed total angular momentum to the Helmholtz equation—for three-dimensional scalar, vector, and tensor fields. The vector TAM waves of given total angular momentum can be decomposed further into a set of three basis functions of fixed orbital angular momentum, a set of fixed helicity, or a basis consisting of a longitudinal (L) and two transverse (E and B) TAM waves. The symmetric traceless rank-2 tensor TAM waves can be similarly decomposed into a basis of fixed orbital angular momentum or fixed helicity, or a basis that consists of a longitudinal (L), two vector (VE and VB, of opposite parity), and two tensor (TE and TB, of opposite parity) waves. We show how all of the vector and tensor TAM waves can be obtained by applying derivative operators to scalar TAM waves. This operator approach then allows one to decompose a vector field into three covariant scalar fields for the L, E, and B components and symmetric-traceless-tensor fields into five covariant scalar fields for the L, VE, VB, TE, and TB components. We provide projections of the vector and tensor TAM waves onto vector and tensor spherical harmonics. We provide calculational detail to facilitate the assimilation of this formalism into cosmological calculations. As an example, we calculate the power spectra of the deflection angle for gravitational lensing by density perturbations and by gravitational waves. We comment on an alternative approach to cosmic microwave background fluctuations based on TAM waves.

Theoretical studies have shown that the expansivity correlates with fragility near Tg; the experimental results presented here show that at high temperature they become anticorrelated. From energy landscape arguments, this indicates the existence of a crossover temperature for the expansivity-fragility correlation that scales inversely with the liquid fragility.

For slowly rotating black holes, the quasinormal mode’s real frequency is a linear combination of the orbit’s precessional and orbital frequencies, but the correspondence is otherwise unchanged. In this paper, we find a relationship between the quasinormal-mode frequencies of Kerr black holes of arbitrary (astrophysical) spins and general spherical photon orbits, which is analogous to the relationship for slowly rotating holes. To derive this result, we first use the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation to compute accurate algebraic expressions for large-l quasinormal-mode frequencies. Comparing our Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin calculation to the leading-order, geometric-optics approximation to scalar-wave propagation in the Kerr spacetime, we then draw a correspondence between the real parts of the parameters of a quasinormal mode and the conserved quantities of spherical photon orbits. At next-to-leading order in this comparison, we relate the imaginary parts of the quasinormal-mode parameters to coefficients that modify the amplitude of the scalar wave. With this correspondence, we find a geometric interpretation of two features of the quasinormal-mode spectrum of Kerr black holes: First, for Kerr holes rotating near the maximal rate, a large number of modes have nearly zero damping; we connect this characteristic to the fact that a large number of spherical photon orbits approach the horizon in this limit. Second, for black holes of any spins, the frequencies of specific sets of modes are degenerate; we find that this feature arises when the spherical photon orbits corresponding to these modes form closed (as opposed to ergodically winding) curves.'},\n",

Since the amplitude of the convergence power spectrum scales as the square of the amplitude of the density fluctuations, the 4σ detection of the lensing signal measures the amplitude of density fluctuations to 12%.'},\n",

While small islands on the scale of λ≤5 ion inertial length (di) coalesce rapidly and do not support significant flux pileup, coalescence of larger islands is characterized by large flux pileup and a weaker time averaged reconnection rate that scales as di/λ while the peak rate remains nearly independent of island size. For the largest islands (λ=100di), reconnection is bursty and nearly shuts off after the first bounce, reconnecting ∼20% of the available flux.'},\n",
       " {'http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevd.84.022002': 'The future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA will be able to measure parameters of coalescing massive black hole binaries, often to extremely high accuracy. Previous work has demonstrated that the black hole spins can have a strong impact on the accuracy of parameter measurement. Relativistic spin-induced precession modulates the waveform in a manner which can break degeneracies between parameters, in principle significantly improving how well they are measured. Recent studies have indicated, however, that spin precession may be weak for an important subset of astrophysical binary black holes: those in which the spins are aligned due to interactions with gas. In this paper, we examine how well a binary’s parameters can be measured when its spins are partially aligned and compare results using waveforms that include higher post-Newtonian harmonics to those that are truncated at leading quadrupole order. We find that the weakened precession can substantially degrade parameter estimation. This degradation is particularly devastating for the extrinsic parameters sky position and distance. Absent higher harmonics, LISA typically localizes the sky position of a nearly aligned binary a factor of ∼6 less accurately than for one in which the spin orientations are random. Our knowledge of a source’s sky position will thus be worst for the gas-rich systems which are most likely to produce electromagnetic counterparts. Fortunately, higher harmonics of the waveform can make up for this degradation. By including harmonics beyond the quadrupole in our waveform model, we find that the accuracy with which most of the binary’s parameters are measured can be substantially improved. In some cases, parameters can be measured as well in partially aligned binaries as they can be when the binary spins are random.'}]"
